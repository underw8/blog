# üêõ Using Cloudflare Access Service Tokens with a Single JSON Header

### TL;DR

* Cloudflare Access supports single-header service token authentication using JSON
* The JSON keys must be lowercase: `cf-access-client-id`, `cf-access-client-secret`
* Set `read_service_tokens_from_header` to your custom header name

### Background

Cloudflare Access supports authenticating requests to protected resources using service tokens, typically via two headers:

```
CF-Access-Client-Id: <client_id>
CF-Access-Client-Secret: <client_secret>
```

However, for some use cases‚Äîespecially API calls or automation, my case is MCP workers with Zero Trust protected‚Äîyou may want to consolidate authentication into a single header. While [Cloudflare‚Äôs documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/identity/service-tokens/#authenticate-with-a-single-header) mentions this, one critical detail is not clearly documented: **the required lowercase key names in the JSON payload**.

Funny enough, even their sample cURL command is in the incorrect format ‚Äî wrong casing and use of underscores. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Problem

Attempting to use a single header like this:

```
curl -H 'Authorization: {"CF-Access-Client-Id": "abc", "CF-Access-Client-Secret": "def"}' \
     https://example.workers.dev
```

‚Ä¶results in a 403 Forbidden, even if:

* The token values are correct
* The header is well-formed
* Your Cloudflare Access app is configured with `read_service_tokens_from_header`

### Solution

Use lowercase keys in the JSON string:

```
curl -H 'Authorization: {"cf-access-client-id": "abc", "cf-access-client-secret": "def"}' \
     https://example.workers.dev
```

This works only if:

* The `read_service_tokens_from_header` field is set (via Terraform, API)
* The JSON is valid and properly escaped
* The header name matches exactly
