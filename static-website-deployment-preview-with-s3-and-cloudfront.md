### Architecture

(chart here . . .)

A user access "sprint-0x.preview.domain.app" will be redirect to "sprint-0x" folder which contains deployment preview for the first sprint.

The "sprint-0x" subdomain can be named/entered with anything as long as there is a folder on the bucket that has the same name.

### Perquisites

* A separated S3 bucket for deployment preview websites (I'll explain why below)
* A subdomain use specifically for deployment preview, i.e: preview.domain.app
* Wildcard ACM certificates for bot \`us-east-1\` region and the region your app are hosted.
* A CloudFront distribution with a wildcard alternative domain name for serving static website and also act as CDN.
* A Lambda@Edge function hosted on CloudFront distribution that works as a router (optionally as a basic authenticator since preview app tend to not be public)

The total cost at the time of creation is $0.5 for Route53 hosted zone, other charges may be incurred depends on the number of traffics.

### Manually deploy

1. Create a S3 bucket for deployment preview static websites. Each deployment preview will be putted in a separated folder. For example:
2. Create a domain and Route53 hosted zone for our deployment preview sites. Example, preview.domain.app.
3. Request for wildcard ACM certificates on both \`us-east-1\` (for CloudFront) and the region your websites are hosted.
4. Create a CloudFront distribution with the deployment preview bucket as origin and the wildcard domain and certificate.
5. Create a Route53 wildcard record pointing to our newly created CloudFront distribution.
6. Create a Lambda@Edge function in \`us-east-1\` region and deploy to CloudFront.
