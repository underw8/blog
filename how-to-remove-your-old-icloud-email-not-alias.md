# 📬 How to remove your old iCloud email (not alias)

If you once created your Apple ID using a _hideous_ iCloud email address and now deeply regret it, here’s some good news: Apple finally allows you to remove that address. But — of course — it’s Apple, so it’s not as straightforward as it should be.

When you try to remove your _only_ iCloud address, you’ll hit an error with a wonderfully cryptic message:\
&#xNAN;**“Could not connect to iCloud – Error Description not available.”**\
What the hell, Apple?

After playing detective/QA engineer for a while, here’s what I found:

* You _can’t_ remove your only iCloud email address unless you replace it with another iCloud address.
* That means you’ll need to **create a new iCloud email alias** first.
* The old address will still show up as an alias in your iCloud Mail settings — but you _can_ delete it later if you want.

## How to Fix It

1. **Create a new iCloud alias (**[**original Apple article**](https://support.apple.com/en-vn/guide/icloud/mm6b1a490a/icloud)**)**:
   * Go to [icloud.com/mail](https://www.icloud.com/mail) and sign in.
   * Click gear icon at the top of the [Mailboxes list](https://support.apple.com/en-vn/guide/icloud/aside/mm19f60abc9b/1.0/icloud/1.0), then choose Settings.
   * Click Account, then click Add Alias.
2. **Link the alias to your Apple ID**:
   * On your iPhone or Apple device, open **Settings**
   * Tap your name at the top (Apple ID banner)
   * Go to **Sign-In & Security** → **Add Email or Phone Number**
   * Add the new alias. Apple will send a verification code to your old iCloud email. Confirm it.
3. **Remove the old address**:
   * Back on the **Sign-In & Security** screen, tap the old address and select **Remove from Account**.
   * Done. Finally.

That’s it — you’re free from that cringey iCloud email. No more shame every time you send an email from your Apple ID.
